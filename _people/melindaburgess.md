Melinda is a content strategist and culture ambassador on a fully distributed team that helps government agencies modernize their services. Besides planning, writing, and managing digital content at CivicActions, she develops and implements organizational processes that help teams work smarter and better together while physically apart. As a mother of three, Melinda advocates and develops resources for parents who work from home (and contributes to the normalization of kids making random appearances during video calls)! She also serves on the board of AGL Association, a nonprofit supporting public sector innovation.
